# Airbnb Project using R

## Project Overview
This project presents a complete workflow for **Airbnb listings** using R and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze raw data to produce an analysis-ready dataset suitable for statistical modeling and further inference.

The notebook emphasizes reproducibility, clarity, and professional presentation.

## Project Objectives
- Load and inspect the raw dataset
- Clean and preprocess variables
- Perform feature engineering
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate summary statistics and visualizations

## Files
- `Project_Nikitina.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis
- `Project_Nikitina.html` — Rendered HTML report (recommended for viewing)
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## How to View
